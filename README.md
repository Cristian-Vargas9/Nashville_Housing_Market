# Nashville Housing Market


### Intro:

Covid has made an impact to everything in today's world in one way or another. Nashville's housing market was greatly affected by the pandemic in a "good" way. There are a few factors to keep in mind such as interest rates hitting an all time low in decades, as well as a very low inventory for buyers to choose from. It has also been said that new residential construction has been down significally compared to other decades. Working in the real estate field, this is something I deal with every weekend! From here I decided to take a deeper dive into residential building permits issued in the past 4 years in the Nashville area. I also wanted to look further into population trends in the Nashville area, and see if the demographics correlate in any way.
